For a long time, Codewars platform suffered a problem of being undocumented, obscure, and often confusing, especially for new users. To mitigate this issue, Codewars introduced [documentation site](https://docs.codewars.com/) with documentation which can be created and maintained by community.

Documentation is still work in progress with many TODOs and gaps to be filled in, but you can already find some useful things there:
- [Introductory section](https://docs.codewars.com/training/getting-started/) which walks new users through their first steps and makes them familiar with basic Codewars [concepts](https://docs.codewars.com/concepts/).
- [Tutorials](https://docs.codewars.com/tutorials/) on authoring kata and translation. Couple of them is already finished, some is a work in progress, and there's definitely more to come!
- [Recipes and HOWTOs](https://docs.codewars.com/recipes/) explaining how to realize common tasks.
- [References](https://docs.codewars.com/references/) explaining some technical details on available features and the platform and its setup.


One big topic which the documentation attempts to tackle is support for content authors (kata creators, translators, and reviewers) to help them provide Codewars with content of high quality, which everyone would find fun to work with. That's why a large set of [content authoring guidelines](https://docs.codewars.com/authoring/guidelines/) was created for authors, and complemented by a set of [articles on curation and maintenance](https://docs.codewars.com/curating/) for reviewers, approvers, and maintainers.

Documentation is still work in progress and it's open for contributions from community. It's stored on [codewars/docs](https://github.com/codewars/docs) GitHub repository which is publicly accessible and everyone is invited to help. If you do not feel confident writing actual articles, then don't worry, there's a lot of ways you can participate:
- Post your ideas and suggestions for articles on [documentation repo board](https://github.com/codewars/docs/issues). It will be much easier to create new articles when it's known what users need! You can also give feedback, comment, or simply react on existing tasks to let us know what you need.
- Provide feedback on  pull requests with changes and proposals of articles [waiting for review](https://github.com/codewars/docs/projects/1). Any help counts: proofreading, verification of grammar and wording, hunting for typos or broken links, and remarks on the subject.
- Let us know when you find some problems with published content. Ideally you would create a [pull request](https://github.com/codewars/docs/pulls) with a fix, but you can also report an [issue](https://github.com/codewars/docs/issues).
- Use the documentation, and spread the knowledge about it, and use links to documentation pages when answering questions. Documentation is useless if it's not read. One of the goals is that whenever a question from a user pops up, be it about how Codewars works, how to achieve some goal, or about the Codewars UI, others can simply paste a link to the relevant documentation page. When you notice that some question reappears particularly often, but there's no page to link the users to, just let us know by creating an appropriate issue on [documentation repo board](https://github.com/codewars/docs/issues), and it will be povided.

In the future we plan to embed or link some parts of the documentation directly into the Codewars website and show relevant articles when user performs specific actions. For example, when a user enters the kata editor to create new kata, they will be notified about articles which could be potentially helpful with the task.

Amount of published articles will grow, and they will be anounced with this blog so you do not miss anything interesting. Your contributions can make them even better!
