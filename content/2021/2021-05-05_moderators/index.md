Until recently, Codewars maintainers and admins were overwhelmed by the number of tasks related not only to the maintenance of the platform, fixing bugs, and adding new features but also by issues related to Codewars content and users (poor **@Kazk** \*hug\*). Sometimes it was just too much for them.

To take some of the burden off their backs, a group of trusted community members has been selected and granted a title of **moderator**, forming the community support team: a team that would help admins handle certain tasks related to users and content. Thanks to recent efforts in refactoring, it was finally possible to introduce additional tools and features that can be used by privileged members to perform additional tasks.

Moderators are meant to be the first line of support for Codewars users and intermediaries between the community and administrators. They have access to tools that help them with handling bad-quality content, as well as problematic and dishonest users. They can also manage Codewars repositories used for tracking [documentation](https://github.com/codewars/docs) or [content issues](https://github.com/codewars/content-issues/issues). Whenever a new moderation feature is added which would be helpful for regular users in some way, we will announce it with a dedicated post.

The effectiveness of moderators' work heavily relies on their communication with community members. After all, they cannot help if they do not know that something is wrong, right? Whenever you encounter some issue like a kata with some serious flaw, a solution that should not be there, a user causing some grief, just [let them know](https://docs.codewars.com/community/moderation/#how-to-get-in-touch). [This reference page](https://docs.codewars.com/community/moderation-tools/) lists the ways moderators can help you. A dedicated [help page](https://docs.codewars.com/community/moderation/#moderators) describes details on the current state of the moderation team, list of users, and their responsibilities.

We hope that support from the moderators will improve the handling of problems that bugged Codewars for so long. They will help with communication between community members and staff, bringing them closer together. Moderators will also relieve administrators from some of the most mundane tasks, letting them focus on providing new features, fixing bugs, and improving Codewars overall.
