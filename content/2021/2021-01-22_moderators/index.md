Until recently, Codewars maintainers and admins were overwhelmed by amount of tasks related not only to the maintenance of the platform, fixing bugs, and adding new features, but also by issues related to Codewars content and users (poor **@Kazk** \*hug\*). Sometimes it was just too much for them.

To take some of the burden off of their backs, a group of trusted community members has been selected and granted a title of **moderator**, forming the community support team: a team which would help admins handling some tasks related to users and content. Thanks to recent refactorings it was finally possible to introduce additional tools and features which can be used by priviledged members to perform additional tasks.

Moderators are meant to be the first line of support for Codewars users and intermediaries between community, and administrators. They have access to tools which help them with handling bad quality content, problematic and dishonest users, they can also manage Codewars repositories used for tracking [documentation](https://github.com/codewars/docs) or [content issues](https://github.com/codewars/content-issues/issues). Whenever a new moderation feature will be added which would be in some way helpful for regular users, we will announce it with a dedicated post.

Effectivity of moderators' work heavily relies on their communication with community members. After all, they cannot help if they do not know that something is wrong, right? Whenever you encounter some issue like a kata with some serious flaw, a solution which should not be there, a user causing some grief, just [let them know](https://docs.codewars.com/community/moderation/#how-to-get-in-touch). Some more details on current state of the moderation team, list of users, and possible ways they could help, is listed on dedicated [help page](https://docs.codewars.com/community/moderation/#moderators). 

We hope that support from the moderators will improve handling of problems which bugged Codewars for so long. They will help with communication between community members and staff, bringing them closer together. Moderators will also relieve administrators from some of the most mundane tasks, letting them focus on providing new features, fixing bugs, and improving Codewars overall.
