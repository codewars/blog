A big thanks to our community for continued support and participation. We have added more languages and updated language versions.

## Functional Languages for the Web

Are you used to working within the JavaScript ecosystem or are you looking for a safer way to program? We have recently added some new statically typed functional languages that are worth taking a look at.

### PureScript

> A strongly-typed functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript
>
> [_http://www.purescript.org/_](http://www.purescript.org/)

- [Integers: Recreation One](https://www.codewars.com/kata/integers-recreation-one/purescript)
- [Power of two](https://www.codewars.com/kata/power-of-two/purescript)
- [Isomorphism](https://www.codewars.com/kata/isomorphism/purescript)

### Elm

> A delightful language for reliable web apps. _Generate JavaScript with great performance and no runtime exceptions._
> 
> [_https://elm-lang.org/_](https://elm-lang.org/)

- [Decode the Morse code](https://www.codewars.com/kata/decode-the-morse-code/elm)
- [Duplicate Encoder](https://www.codewars.com/kata/duplicate-encoder/elm)
- [Backspaces in string](https://www.codewars.com/kata/backspaces-in-string/elm)

### Reason

> Reason lets you write simple, fast and quality type safe code while leveraging both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems.
> 
> [_https://reasonml.github.io/_](https://reasonml.github.io/)

- [Looking for a benefactor](https://www.codewars.com/kata/looking-for-a-benefactor/reason)
- [Floating-point Approximation (II)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/floating-point-approximation-ii/reason)
- [Sum by Factors](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-by-factors/reason)

## Languages with Dependent Types

We’re also very happy to introduce Idris and Agda! Special thanks to [gallais](https://github.com/gallais) and [ice1000](https://github.com/ice1000) for helping us add Agda.

### Idris

> A general purpose pure functional programming language with dependent types.
> 
> [_https://www.idris-lang.org/_](https://www.idris-lang.org/)

### Agda

> Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language.
> 
> [https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php)

We’ll be honest. We don’t know these languages enough to write nice introductions, but some of our users are extremely excited to have theorem proving challenges on Codewars. If you’re interested to start learning, check out 8 kyu [“Theorem proving hello world: prove a+0=a and 0+a=a”](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5c879811bc562909bf65c8e6).

The addition of these languages brings our count of supported languages to 41! Our library is steadily growing with kata built around the new languages and we would love to see more contributions from you! Check out some of the kata above.

## New Language Versions

- Dart 2.1
- Java 11
- Kotlin 1.3
- Rust 1.33
- TypeScript 3.3

We hope you enjoy these updates! We are continually working to improve the platform, so thank **you** for your patience and continued use of Codewars.
