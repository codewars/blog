With the new solutions tag voting now in place, we have revamped the code that handled the honor. It turns out there was a bug that was causing some honor to not be earned. 

Over the course of the next few days you may notice that your honor gets adjusted. For most of you, your honor will go up. Our process for updating the honor is a bit slow as we want to be very thorough and clean up some data, so please be patient!
