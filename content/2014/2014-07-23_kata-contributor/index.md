We have added the ability to have kata contributors. Users who achieve an honor of 1500 or more will be allowed to contribute to other user's kata during the beta period. This allows kata to be improved even faster.

### How does it work?

By default, any kata can be edited. Kata authors can choose to turn of contributions if they wish. However, if a kata has outstanding issues that are left open for longer than 5 days, we will automatically enable the ability to have other users contribute to the kata. 

If you have the ability, you can edit the kata as if it were your own. When you save a revision will be made so that everyone can see who changed what. The kata author will also be notified of any changes that you make.
