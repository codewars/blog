Just a quick note. Some of you might notice that your honor jumped up recently. This will be in large part due to the following corrected issue that was recently released.

If you have translated a kata before, some of the points that you earned for those translations may have been recently lost. We have now corrected the issue and you will receive all of your points for translations that have been approved, as well as 1 honor point for each kumite and translation fork that you have published.
