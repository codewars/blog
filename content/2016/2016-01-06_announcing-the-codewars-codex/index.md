title: Announcing the Codewars Codex!
---

As a quick update we wanted to let you know of a new resource that is available. One of our top users, [bkaes](http://codewars.com/users/bkaes), has been working on a [Codewars Codex](http://bkaestner.github.io/codewars-rules/) for some time now. A new version was recently released and we wanted to let the entire community know about it. If you are interested in creating kata for Codewars, this is a must read. The codex provides tons of advice and helpful insights into the kata creation process. 

Codewars is a community driven platform. From content creation to moderation, the community has become a vibrant group of developers who have taken it upon themselves to contribute to the greater good. We would like to thank [bkaes](http://codewars.com/users/bkaes) and all of the other Codewars Senseis who have contributed. 


Now go [check out the Codex!](http://bkaestner.github.io/codewars-rules/) After reading it please feel free to discuss it in the [Codex Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/bkaestner/codewars-rules).
